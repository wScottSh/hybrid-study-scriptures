This project is to work on on Sundays. It's a hybrid set of scriptures with both a physical and digital component. The physical component includes a link to a webpage on every single page. The webpage that it links to is a unique page for each chapter in the scriptures. So, for example, every page within the book of Mark links to a profile page for Mark on the web.

The profile pages for each chapter will be exportable (nothing like losing your notes...).

Each page has several sections that complement each other:
- A section to add links
- A general note taking pad
- notes attached to those links
- and, if it's been scanned in, the image of the chapter itself
- and more to come as I flesh out the concept a little more.

The physical component is a little more difficult for integration, but that's the main challenge I'd like to tackle here. Aside from just making the product in the first place, of course. Here's [a link](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s23/sh/7bda1387-647d-4bef-8eb6-b16f3becdee9/ce2841cd55e93ba1415e73819751d53a) to a scribble I made that shows the general concept.
