This project is to work on on Sundays. It's a hybrid set of scriptures with both a physical and digital component. The physical component includes a link to a webpage on every single page. The webpage that it links to is a unique page for each chapter in the scriptures. So, for example, every page within the book of Mark links to a profile page for Mark on the web.

The profile pages for each chapter will be exportable (nothing like losing your notes...). And the project will be open sourced with no commercial restrictions. I want to be able to make some money selling the service I create, but also want the service to be amazing more than I want it to be closed. The more people studying their scriptures the better.

Each page has several sections that complement each other:
- A section to add links
- A general note taking pad
- notes attached to those links
- and, if it's been scanned in, the image of the chapter itself
- An account system/service
- A way to create digital links on top of the images based on shapes (like tagging on FB?)
- and more to come as I flesh out the concept a little more.

The physical component is a little more difficult for integration, but that's the main challenge I'd like to tackle here. Aside from just making the product in the first place, of course. Here's [a link](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s23/sh/7bda1387-647d-4bef-8eb6-b16f3becdee9/ce2841cd55e93ba1415e73819751d53a) to a scribble I made that shows the general concept.

With the physical component, I'll need to create:
- the layout for the scriptures
- the URL generator based on unique codes (not mass produced, apparently)
- a way to make sure all the pages can fit in the binding the way I want them to
- a smart scanning feature that will organize your scanned book into their appropriate chapters online
